## About

With over 8 years of software engineering experience, I am a versatile and adaptable professional who can deliver high-quality frontend and backend solutions. My mission is to create engaging and reliable web video applications that enhance user experience and satisfaction. I have a strong background in computing science, management science, and business administration, and I am certified in project management. I am currently looking for new opportunities to leverage my skills and knowledge in a dynamic and innovative organization.

In my most recent role as a Senior Software Engineer at Loom, I contributed to both the frontend and backend development of the platform, using TypeScript, React Native, Swift, Objective-C, and C++. I implemented multiresolution UI and interface to Shaka Player, improving the video playback quality and performance. I also refactored electron with TypeScript, reducing maintenance costs and increasing code readability. Additionally, I mentored peers to take up managerial functions, and advocated for pair programming and collaboration, fostering a positive and productive team culture. …see more

Experienced Human Resources Professional / Strategic People & Culture Partner to Leadership

December 3, 2011, Pamela worked with June on the same team

Working with June for Marketing in Focus 2011 was quite the learning experience for me. Marketing in Focus was my first SMA pillar event and I was definitely a newbie to event planning. I can honestly say that June is a great teacher and mentor. His ways are unique but they produce excellent results. Without June's careful instruction and planning, Marketing in Focus 2011 wouldn't have turned out as successfully as it did. I am grateful for the learning experience and would gladly work with June again.

October 8, 2018, June worked with Kaiwen on the same team

Kai worked me on a React Native project where iOS & Android clients needed to respond to dispatchers' calls as technicians. When I had trouble with the very fickle build process, he was able to help me with it with his knowledge of the build chain. He also helped with styled components and other CSS-related tasks that I was unfamiliar with as an iOS engineer.

Senior Vice President | Recruitment

September 12, 2018, June was Daniel’s client

Out of the 300+

recruiters that reached out to me on LinkedIn, Daniel was by far the most efficient and outstanding. Even before scheduling a phone call, he got to the point of presenting the companies he's working with so that he understood my preferences.      

Other recruiters normally schedule a phone call days in advance to ask questions to answers in which they do not understand, Daniel scheduled for me phone calls with people in the companies directly. He didn't waste any time in email correspondence and only called when he needed to. My time was well-respected.      

Daniel made the point to follow-up to every phone screening and technical challenge I've faced, and actively kept me up to date even during after-hours. He understood that for each hour that I'm not pursuing with one of his companies, I'm pursuing some other job presented by some other lesser recruiter.      

When it came time for one of the companies making an offer, he took the time to really assure me that it's a great opportunity. Where other recruiters would have been waiting for thank-you letters in their mail, Daniel was proactive in making sure that I follow through to accepting the offer with confidence. He's the first person I would contact if in case I need a job again, and would recommend to my engineer friends.
